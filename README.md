# Learning Portal Product
---
***Project Description:*** v.01-mwybrow
>This project is basically a loosely coupled front end, which will eventually replace the current Salesforce interface. Design with intention of absorbing exposed Salesforce API's currently used in the Salesforce Application Portal.

### Setting up On Local dev environment
As with many technologies, itâ€™s vital to have the proper foundation set up first, before moving on to solving more complex problems. 
- Please ensure you have Node & Yarn or Npm installed.
### Install Steps
- Download with Git:
```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:username/portalproduct-react.git ...
```
- Installation First run
> Step One: First run requires you to run the initial terminal setup cmd once. 
> Step Two: The staging Endpoint api is also required until all Salesforce endpoints are exposed. Currently, they can be viewed at 
- http://localhost:3004/companyInfo
- http://localhost:3004/studentSessions
- http://localhost:3004/tutorSessions

 *( only after the devapi is started.) *
>These end points are compiled from the current json packets sent via Salesforce to each Lighting Component.
